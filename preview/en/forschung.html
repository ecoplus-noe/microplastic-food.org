      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        The omnipresence of plastics and their decay products poses ever greater
        challenges to the economy, society and the entire ecosystem, to which
        the EU has responded by initiating the European strategy for plastics in
        the circular economy. Microplastics (MP), which are made up of very
        small plastic fragments with dimensions in the μm range, are a source of
        plastic entering the environment. According to the EU Commission, around
        75,000 to 300,000 t of microplastics enter the environment in Europe
        every year. Microplastics are divided into primary and secondary MPs.
        Primary microplastics include plastic particles in the μm range, which
        are used as basic material for the production of various products in the
        cosmetics, hygiene, medical and textile industries. Secondary
        microplastics, on the other hand, arise from physical, biological and
        chemical degradation and decay of macroplastic parts and make up the
        majority of the occurring MP.
      </p>
      <h2>Objectives</h2>
      <p>
        The aim is to develop a valid analytical method for the undoubted
        qualitative and quantitative detection of MP in food. Based on the
        measurement results of reference materials and real samples, possible
        sources of contamination (environment, raw materials, filling plants,
        packaging) will be identified and preventive measures to avoid MP in
        food and beverages will be proposed. In particular, small and
        medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that are confronted with MP in the food
        and packaging industry gain a competitive edge through this project.
      </p>
      <h2>Concept</h2>
      <p>
        In this project, three leading research institutions UBT and IPF in
        Germany and OFI in Austria aim to jointly work out an analytic
        methodology for the detection and identification of MPs for the food and
        packaging industry. Innovative spectroscopic imaging tools and advanced
        data processing methods will be developed which allow for the generation
        of validated and reliable data (qualitative and quantitative) on MP
        contamination of food and beverages. In detailed case studies, the
        sources of entry in important food groups (i) water and filtered
        beverages, (ii) soluble food, (iii) food surfaces will be determined by
        using standardized MP sampling protocols, well defined workflows for the
        micro-spectroscopic analysis and data treatment. In addition, general
        sampling instructions to test the impact of packaging and filling
        systems on the MP-content in beverages and on/in food will be derived
        and tested in 3 types of packaging and filling plants.
