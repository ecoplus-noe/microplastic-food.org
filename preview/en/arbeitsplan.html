      <h1><p>Workplan</p></h1>
      <p>
        The project “microplastic@food” will be executed in five steps: in the
        first step (WP 2) the sample preparation and concentration will be
        optimized, and a MP-reference system will be generated. In the next step
        (WP 3) these MP-samples function as basis for the identification and
        quantification with FTIR- and Raman microscopy methods. All spectra
        collected from the MP reference samples undergo in WP 4 an automatic
        data processing step. Based on the validated method, in WP 5 samples
        from filling and packaging plants will be evaluated for MP (e.g.
        identification, quantification) followed by the analysis of food samples
        (WP 6) from beverages, soluble food and food surfaces. The work packages
        Project management (WP 1) and Dissemination (WP 7) accompanies the RTO
        work packages
      </p>

      <h2>WP1 - Project Management</h2>
      <p>
        In this work package, ecoplus, together with IVLV, takes over the
        project coordination from project planning, technical and financial
        management to reporting. At the beginning of the project, the consortium
        agreement is drawn up together with the research partners and the IP
        rules are negotiated. During the project, meetings of the steering
        committee are organised, and the progress of the project is communicated
        to the participating company partners and interim results are discussed.
        In the area of project controlling, attention is paid to the timely
        achievement of the milestones and - if necessary - corrective measures
        are defined in the work plan.
      </p>
      <h2>WP2 - Preparation Microplastic Reference Material</h2>
      <p>
        In the first step, MP reference samples (composition known i.e. the most
        important packaging plastics including PP, PE, PVC, PU, PET, PS, ABS,
        PA, PC, PMMA, PAN, PLA, PMDS, PVPP as well as plastic fibres such as
        PET, PAN) will be produced in three size classes - 1000-50 µm, 50-10 µm,
        10-1 µm for the development and calibration of spectroscopic methods,
        for laboratory comparisons and the development of automated data
        analysis tools (-&gt; WP 3 and WP 4). Furthermore, a general sampling
        protocol (SOP) will be developed for sampling in filling and packaging
        plants as well as at the production line and in ambient air (-&gt; WP
        5). In a further preparatory step, an SOP is drawn up for sample
        preparation, cleaning and concentration procedures for the product
        groups: Water and filtered beverages, milk and liquid dairy products,
        soluble foods (e.g. salt, sugar) and surfaces of packaged foods (rinsing
        liquid) for spectroscopic analysis (Raman &amp; FTIR) (-&gt; WP 6).
      </p>
      <h2>WP3 - Spectroscopic Material Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        In the first step, analytical methods based on vibrational spectroscopy
        (IR and Raman microscopy) will be established for the detection and
        identification of MP (enriched on special filters (-&gt; WP 2). For this
        purpose (a) SOPs for imaging, identification and quantification of MP
        have to be implemented and validated and (b) existing spectral databases
        for samples within this project have to be established and completed and
        (c) a practical detection limit for the determination of MP particles
        for high throughput analysis and for the different sample types within
        this project have to be defined (guidelines). Furthermore, qualitative
        and quantitative determination of MP particles will be performed on
        reference samples and comparison of the different analytical approaches
        will be made. Decide (i) which analytical approach is best suited for
        which sample type (water, beverages, food,...) and (ii) which approach
        is simpler, more reliable and above all faster for specific
        requirements.
      </p>
      <h2>WP4 - Computer-aided Identification of Microplastics (Automation)</h2>
      <p>
        The collected FTIR and Raman spectra of the reference samples - of the
        most important polymers, as prepared in WP 2 and measured in WP 3, will
        be processed with automatic data processing algorithms of the Purency
        software. After an initial calibration and test phase, the spectral data
        of the reference samples including Establishment of a validated approach
        for computer-aided visualisation (size, shape), counting and
        identification (data processing) of MP particles for individual polymer
        types (all analytical methods) will be prepared. The results of the AI
        will be verified by visual checks and both the identification and
        quantification of the polymers will be continuously improved in revision
        cycles.
      </p>
      <h2>WP5 – Evaluation of the Packaging and Filling Systems</h2>
      <p>
        Samples are taken from various filling and packaging lines directly on
        the production lines and in ambient air according to the general
        sampling protocol developed in WP 2. The samples will be analysed for MP
        contamination that could be introduced at different stages in the
        packaging and filling lines (e.g. before and after filling, at
        intermediate stages of the production line). Thus, potential sources of
        MP input and/or generation along packaging and filling processes
        (ambient air, production equipment, abrasion in production lines) can be
        investigated and measures to avoid MP in food, beverages and packaging
        can be derived.

        WP6 - Application in Case studies (I) Beverages, (II) Soluble Foods
        (Salt, Sugar), (III) Complex Packaged Foods that are rinsed off
      </h2>
      <p>
        <strong>1)</strong> Sampling and analysis of potential MP contamination
        of 3 product categories: Beverages, soluble foods and food surfaces. The
        step-by-step SOP description of the sample preparation procedure for
        aqueous samples (mineral water, rinsing solutions, dissolved powder
        solutions) developed in WP 2 is applied.
      </p>
      <h3>Case study I Water, beer, milk and filtered beverages:</h3>
      <p>
        In this task, samples of mineral and spring water, milk and filtered
        beverages such as juices are analysed for MP contamination. Samples of
        the participating project partners (anonymised) are analysed, and the
        effect of the different interfering beverage matrices are removed, as
        milk fat or sugar contaminations have a negative effect on the
        measurability MP and complicate the spectroscopic sample identification.
        The results of the qualitative and quantitative analysis as well as
        possible avoidance measures to reduce potential MP contamination are
        discussed with the respective customer.
      </p>
      <h3>Case study II soluble foods:</h3>
      <p>
        Different types of water-soluble foods (salt, sugar, ...) are the target
        of the second case study. Solutions of the participating partners&#x27;
        products are sampled and analysed for potential MP contamination. The
        step-by-step SOP description of the sample preparation procedure for
        aqueous samples (mineral water, rinsing solutions, dissolved powder
        solutions) developed in WP 2 will be applied.
      </p>
      <h3>Case study III Food surfaces:</h3>
      <p>
        MP can also be found on different types of packaged food (e.g. cheese
        blocks or sausage) caused by MP contamination in the packaging line.
        Therefore, the food surfaces are the target areas to be rinsed and the
        eluate analysed. The products of the participating project partners are
        rinsed after unpacking, filtered and analysed for possible MP
        contamination.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2)</strong> Tracing of MP contamination sources and possible
        solutions to reduce MP contamination together with the respective
        customer.
      </p>
      <h2>WP7 – Dissemination</h2>
      <p>
        In work package 7, the results of the project will be made accessible to
        the interested public, on the one hand via the website, but also via
        scientific lectures („Österr. Verpackungstag&quot;) and publications
        (e.g. „Environmental Science &amp; Technology&quot;, „Analytical
        Method&quot;, „Applied Spectroscopy&quot;). Another goal is to compile
        and publish a catalogue of countermeasures to reduce MP in food and food
        packaging and filling equipment. Continuous participation in
        standardisation bodies such as Austrian Standards International (ASI),
        Committee ON-AG 074 09 and the International Organisation for
        Standardisation (ISO), Committee ISO/TC 61/SC 14/WG 4, is essential to
        enable a bidirectional transfer of knowledge and to contribute to the
        harmonisation process of MP measurement approaches.
