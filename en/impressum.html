      <h4>Session cookies</h4>

        We use so-called cookies with our Internet presence. Cookies are small
        text files or other storage technologies that are placed and stored on
        your terminal device by the Internet browser you use. Through these
        cookies, certain information from you, such as your browser or location
        data or your IP address, is processed to an individual extent. This
        processing makes our website more user-friendly, effective and secure,
        as the processing enables, for example, the reproduction of our website
        in different languages or the offer of a shopping cart function. If the
        processing does not serve to initiate or execute a contract, our
        legitimate interest lies in improving the functionality of our website.
        In this case, the legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. These
        session cookies are deleted when you close your internet browser.
