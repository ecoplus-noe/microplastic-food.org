        The consortium of microplastic@food combines the expertise of
        researchers (RTD) in polymer characterisation (IPF), material sciences
        (OFI) and ecology (UBT) as well as software specialists for automated
        measurements (purency). In addition, the SME User Committee is formed by
        companies along the value chain of food and food packaging. Based on
        their food samples (e.g. mineral water, juice, milk, tofu, beer, salt,
        sugar,…) and plastic materials (e.g. filling, packaging, ...) a valid
        method to analyse MP in food will be developed.

        </h3>
        <p>
          The OFI&#x27;s strength lies in its interdisciplinarity and the
          availability of highly qualified staff (approx. 120 employees,
          academic ratio of 53%) from various fields (from materials chemistry
          to plastics technology to packaging). The project expands the
          OFI&#x27;s business relations with SMEs from food and packaging
          production and plant engineering. The OFI will play two roles in this
          project: as an insider with high expertise in the field of packaging
          &amp; food (Packaging &amp; Food Department of the OFI headed by Dr
          Michael Washüttl) and as an analytical research laboratory with a
          strong focus on sample preparation and various measurement methods in
          FTIR spectroscopy and microscopy (single point, mapping and imaging).

        <p>
          Purency’s core competence is the fast development of machine learning
          applications for hyperspectral imaging. The company delivers its
          services by means of a modular frame software, which combines the
          custom made machine learning models with a graphical user interface to
          streamline the data analysis process.

        <h3>Leibniz Institute of Polymer Research Dresden e.V.</h3>
        <p>
          The current challenges in energy, mobility, health, sustainability and
          communication require new technologies and materials. Polymers offer
          unique opportunities to tailor materials and launch innovative
          technologies. At the IPF, researchers from different disciplines
          cooperate to exploit this fascinating potential. As a member of the
          Leibniz Association, the institute is dedicated to
          application-oriented basic research and is strongly networked at the
          Dresden site, nationally and internationally. The experienced
          specialists in spectroscopy (FTIR, NIR, UV/VIS, Raman and ultrasound)
          and multivariate data analysis (quantitative analysis, statistical
          process control, real-time process analysis) identify and quantify
          microplastic particles in aquatic systems but also food samples.

        <h3>University of Bayreuth</h3>
        <p>
          University of Bayreuth is a research-orientated campus university in
          the north of Bavaria, Germany and is ranked No 29 among 200 top
          universities younger than 50 years (THE ranking). Currently, nearly
          13,000 students are enrolled. UBT has established profile areas (PA)
          gathering researchers from different faculties working on
          interdisciplinary topics. Amongst those, Polymer &amp; Colloid Science
          (PA-PC) and University of Bayreuth Centre of Ecology and Environmental
          Research (BayCEER) are among the most prestigious research centres in
          Eu-rope and support their members with an excellent infrastructure for
          research activities which are also fruitful for the proposed CORNET
          project. Prof. Dr. Christian Laforsch holds the chair of Animal
          Ecology I at the University of Bayreuth. His research focuses on
          biological adaptation to environmental stressors and in this context
          he investigates ecotoxicological effects of anthropogenic substances
          with state-of-the-art techniques from life history to molecular
          markers. In this context, he was among the first authors addressing
          the contamination of freshwater ecosystems with MPs.

          <p>
            In the framework of precompetitive collective research solutions to
            problems are developed under coordination of the IVLV. The
            non‐profit industry association generates research pro-jects and
            provides the funding for collective industrial research. The IVLV is
            engaged in 33 joint research projects on key topics such as
            preservation of food quality, compliance of packaging materials and
            filling and packaging processes. The special aim of IVLV is to
            sup-port the research and development of SMEs.
